#Lab: IAM + OpenTelemetry + Prometheus on Kubernetes


Goal:
Students will explore how IAM governs access to cloud resources from inside Kubernetes, and how OpenTelemetry and Prometheus can instrument, collect, and visualize application metrics and traces.
Weâ€™ll use the same EKS cluster from previous labs.
